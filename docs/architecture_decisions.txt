I decided to split the web services into two microservices. A microservice working for persons and connection and a microservice for Locations. 
This is because there is a dependence on persons and connections. The location could be separated without much trouble.
A Kafka message is created every time that we post against persons. This will be used for future connections with other systems. 
Location microservice has two entry points, one through REST and another against GRPC. Depending on how much information we send to GRPC, we can choose between REST or GRPC.
